## Collaboration

With the new collaboration feature, it is now easier than ever to work on a genezio project as a team. As an owner of the project, you have full control and you can invite your colleagues or revoke permissions anytime. Once people are invited and they accept the invitation, they can see the project details, use the test interface to test the project, or deploy new versions of the code.

## New project wizard

Start a new project with just a few clicks using our new wizard. You configure to bootstrap your project as a mono repo or multi repo. We will create the repositories for you together with the GitHub workflows. This means that you only have to push to a branch and the deployment is done for you.

## Queues

We are happy to announce another integration: Upstash Qstash queues. Now you can use Qstash to make your work easier with simple ways to manage tasks in a queue, update different services without hassle, and set up schedules for tasks and emails.
